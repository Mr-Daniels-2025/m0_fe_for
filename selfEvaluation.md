# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
* I am more confident; however, I still need more practice.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
* I have both an unproductive and productive struggle.  Reading the lesson material made sense; however, I struggled (unproductively) when I tried to apply it.  I finally did a pairing and Zoom call to get more familiar with the lesson material here.  That helped a lot.  I then was able to understand and apply the key concepts.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I need to practice similar scenarios with this until I am very proficient and productive.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* My questions are related to the learning tools (w3schools reference and the mdn web docs link for JavaScript expressions and operators) and how and when to use them.
